# Consulting Services

Our [mission](/about#mission-statement) at The New Oil is to educate and empower readers to take their privacy back from invasive corporations who manipulate and monetize their data. However, we recognize that this can be an overwhelming and sometimes confusing endeavour. Especially for readers just starting out for the first time, there's _so much_ to do and no shortage of conflicting (sometimes bad) information and opinions. For this reason, we offer consulting services to help readers navigate their first steps.

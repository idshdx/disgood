# Current Roadmap

In general, funds from The New Oil are primarily used to maintain infrastructure like servers and subscriptions that keep the site running. We also use funds to upgrade equipment (like cameras for content creation), purchase things for testing, and other simlar expenses. You can get a better idea of where contributions go by checking out our latest [transparency report](https://blog.thenewoil.org/transparency-report-2023).

The following is a list of unrealized projects that The New Oil is working to implement using the financial support of our readers. If you want to support us to make any of these projects possible, then please consider [donating](/support). Keep in mind that these projects may be implemented earlier than expected or pushed back depending on funding and time constraints.

  **Reimbursement:** Currently, no one at The New Oil draws a consistent
  paycheck. We sometimes pay freelancers for low-cost or one-time work (such as
  video thumbnails or web development). We hope someday to reimburse Nate (and
  future staff members) for their time spent working on the project, which will
  in return free up more time to focus on The New Oil and reduce dependence on
  "day jobs."

  **Site translation:** Crowdsourced translations efforts are already underway
  via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/the-new-oil). If you speak another
  language, we would love your help translating the site. If the language you
  speak isn't listed, please [contact us](/links#contact) so that we can add it.

  **Mac Mini** Having a budget-model desktop Apple device would help us with
  testing, reviewing, and troubleshooting various tools and techniques for the
  website, most notably recommended settings. In the past we were able to run
  MacOS in a virtual machine, however Apple is making this increasingly
  difficult to the point where it is no longer possible for us.

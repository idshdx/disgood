# Encrypted Realtime Messaging

## What is Encrypted Messaging?

**End-to-end encrytion (E2EE) is a form of communication where the messages are encrypted in such a way that only the people involved in the conversation can read them.** See [Understanding Encryption](/guides/prologue/encryption) for more information on this.

## Why do I Need Encrypted Messaging?

These days, all messages are encrypted (except SMS text messages), but the service provider (Google, Facebook, etc) has the keys to decrypt your messages and can read them if they want to or are ordered to by a warrant. This means that a company can scan your messages to [insert unwelcome ads](https://twitter.com/chrismlacy/status/1409727836093513729) or [alter or block](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/12/18137795/fcc-text-message-rule-classification-spam) messages entirely, or that a [rogue employee](https://www.uscybersecurity.net/cyberNews/shopify-breach/) can steal the images and information you transmit. E2EE Messaging makes this impossible.

## What Should I Look For in an Encrypted Messenger?

**The most important thing is to make sure the person you're contacting is using the same service as you.** These services only work if both parties are using the same encryption system. When making your decision, you should consider if any of your contacts are already widely using an encrypted messenger. If none of your contacts are using an encrypted messenger or if you think there's room for improvement, consider one from the list below.

## Avoid The Following

<Highlighting variant="warning">

- **Telegram** has several serious shorcomings such as [contadictary statements](https://youtu.be/ai67WTuQrPM?si=Pi99_RfDyHax5DFc&t=120) regarding their data disclosure practices, regarding their data disclosure practices, lack of end-to-end encryption by default (plus end-to-end encryption is only available on mobile devices and one cannot encrypt group chats at all), and collecting more [user data](https://telegram.org/privacy#3-what-personal-data-we-use) than a private messenger ideally should. If you insist on using Telegram, consider it an open social media platform and not an encrypted messenger.
- **WhatsApp** is owned by Meta (formerly Facebook), who is a notorious [enemy of privacy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/01/22/whatsapp-facebook-backdoor-government-data-request/#3be52f0c1030), and collects massive amounts of [metadata](/guides/prologue/metadata). While the content itself may be encrypted, there are better options who respect your metadata.

## Honorable Mention: Briar

[Briar](https://briarproject.org/) is only available on Android (and a Linux
version still in testing). It also do not support a method to export chat data.
As such it does not meet the requirements for listing on this website. However,
Androids are far more
[common](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272698/global-market-share-held-by-mobile-operating-systems-since-2009/)
than iPhones in most parts of the world. Additionally, Briar can work even in
parts of the world where the infrastructure is unreliable or has been destroyed.
This is because Briar is a peer-to-peer messenger that does not rely on any
servers - it can connect directly to other devices via Bluetooth or WiFi, making
it both impossible to censor and viable even when the internet or cell towers
are not functional. Furthermore, Briar is specifically designed for journalists,
activists, and those with particularly high threat models. It routes data
through Tor when possible to strip metadata. Briar is considered one of the most
secure options available for private messaging. Again, Briar is not officially
recommended here because it is not cross-platform and is missing chat backup
functionality, but if you live in a highly volatile area with unreliable
networking and a high number of Android users in your area, Briar would be my
top recommendation without reservation.

### Tips & Tricks

Some additional resources for deciding which secure messaging is right for you could include the [Secure Messaging Apps Comparison Chart](https://www.securemessagingapps.com/), [SecuChart](https://bkil.gitlab.io/secuchart/), and [this chart](https://www.messenger-matrix.de/messenger-matrix-en.html).

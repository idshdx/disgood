# Mobile Devices: Replacement Apps

Many of the common or stock apps your device comes with are privacy invasive, collecting data about you and sharing it with your device manufacturer (like Apple, Google, and others). We recommend you replace your default apps and service providers with some of the suggestions listed here to improve your privacy and/or security.

See my criteria for this page [here](/criteria#mobile-settings--apps).

<Criterias data={data} direction="col" />

I encourage you to remove any unused or infrequenly-used apps from your phone. Mobile apps are both invasive for privacy and a potential way entry point for <dfn title="malicious software, commonly (but not always accurately) known as a virus">malware</dfn> and attackers so the fewer you have, the better. Additionally, **if your phone is lost or stolen, having sensitive apps like work email and banking can allow further abuse.**

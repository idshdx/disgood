# Mobile Devices: Settings

**Please note** that your [threat model](/guides/prologue/threat-model/), life circumstances, and personal safety are top priority. These recommendedations are a general "one-size-fits-most" solution to mass data collection. Your situation may require enabling or disabling settings, features, and apps contrary to what we recommend to ensure your own safety or that of your loved ones. Always prioritize your safety and consider what your threat model requires. See my criteria for this page [here](/criteria#mobile-settings--apps).

- General > AirPlay & Handoff > Automatically AirPlay: Never
- General > Keyboards > Enable Dictation: Off
- Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock > the shortest option you can reasonably put up with. Do not set it to leave the screen turned on.
- Wallpaper: Set your lock screen to something that doesn't reveal sensitive personal information (eg, no family photos, etc)
- Siri & Search: Disable everything completely
- Touch/Face ID & Passcode > Stolen Device Protection: Enable
- Touch/Face ID & Passcode > Turn Passcode On: Try to set an [alpha-numeric password](/guides/most-important/passwords) if possible, otherwise use a six-digit PIN. A fingerprint is also acceptable if your device allows it (coupled with a strong password or PIN). Face ID should be avoided.

- Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements: Disable everything
- Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising > Personalized Ads: Off
- Privacy & Security > Lockdown Mode: On (This will [disable](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212650) a significant number of features, however if you are able to live without them, it will help protect other users who need this feature from being [easily identified](https://www.techspot.com/news/95767-apple-upcoming-lockdown-mode-make-devices-easier-fingerprint.html).)
- App Store > App Updates: On
- App Store > Personalized Recommendations: Clear App Usage Data

- Phone > Notifications: Off (if you plan to use [Voice-over-IP](/guides/less-important/voip))
- Phone > Silence unknown callers: On (This is, like everything, user discretion, but for most people this will dramatically reduce the number of spam calls. If you use your SIM number instead of VoIP, be sure to enter any important phone numbers such as a child's school or coworkers into your contacts so you still get their calls.)

- Messages > Filter Unknown Senders: Enabled

- Now scroll back up to Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions > Allowed Apps: Disable everything you do not intend to use.
- Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions > Privacy & Allowed Changes: Set all to "Don't Allow." This will prevent changes from being made on your behalf next time you update.
- Any settings not covered are personal preference and are unlikely to cause any privacy or security issues no matter how you set them.

- **_Note:_** _it is possible to use an Android device without ever signing into a Google account for added privacy. This must be done during device setup. You can use [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) (or another client such as F-Droid Basic) to procure many [open source](/guides/prologue/open-source) apps, and [Aurora Store](https://auroraoss.com) as a proxy for the Play Store for anything else you can't get on F-Droid. Note that with Aurora you will not be able to use Google to process app-related payments such as subscriptions or one-time payments to download the app. In these cases, it should be possible to sign into the Play Store exclusively without signing into Google on the entire device._
- **_Note:_** _Android in particular is capable of a number of powerful, privacy- and security-enhancing strategies that iOS is not, such as the aforementioned "no account required," alternative app stores, sideloading, user profiles, and much more. Some of these are advanced techniques, but not all, though many of them fall outside the scope of this site. For those using or considering an Android device, I strongly encourage you to check out Privacy Guide's [Android page](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/android/) to get an idea of some of the things your phone is capable of._

By enabling all of these settings, you are significantly reducing the amount of tracking and data collection these devices perform, but keep in mind that you are not completely eliminating it.
